# Computational Tools

Ongoing Work on Random Numbers and Monte Carlo simulations (PRNGs, inverse transform sampling and data handling).

## Purpose
This repository takes content covered in my Computationl Tools lectures and expands upon it, through various projects as I attempt to learn code beyond the syllabus. Doing this not only helps to improve my fundamentals in Python and teach me new tools, but also gives me the tools to complete my own, more complex engineering projects alongside my degree.

## Contents
